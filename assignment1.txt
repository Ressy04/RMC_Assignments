1. Write a program to calculate the length of DNA Sequence in python. Take the sequence from user.

seq=input("Enter the sequence: ")
length=len(seq)
print("Length of the entered sequence is: ",length)

Enter the sequence: ATTGCCTAATCCGTAATTT
Length of the entered sequence is:  19

2. Write  a program to calculate the GC percentage of DNA sequence. Take the sequence from the user.

seq=input("Enter a sequence: ")
gc_percentage=100*(seq.count("G")+seq.count("C"))/len(seq)
print("GC% of the entered sequence is: ",gc_percentage)

Enter a sequence: ATTCCGTGCGCTCCACACGGGGG
GC% of the entered sequence is:  69.56521739130434

3. Write a program to mutate a sequence taken from user. Accept sequence as a input from the user. 
Take position and mutated base as argument.

seq=input("Enter the sequence: ")
#inversion
reversed_seq=seq[::-1]
print("The iversed sequence is: ",reversed_seq)
#substitution
substitution=seq.replace("A","G")
print("Sequence after Substitution: ",substitution)

Enter the sequence: AAAATGCTTTG
The iversed sequence is:  GTTTCGTAAAA
Sequence after Substitution:  GGGGTGCTTTG


4. Write a program to slice the sequence in two halves. Print the result. Take the sequence from the user. 

5. Print position of  the 2nd occurrence of “A”  in the sequence “ATCGATAGATACAA”.

6. Write a program to check which stop codons are present in the sequence  “UAAAAGGCGAGAUAAAUA” .

7. suppose that we have few restriction enzyme recognition sites ["ACGTC","CTAGT","ATGCTA"] find sites with 
their frequencies in the DNA sequences of  delta strain of COVID 19.

8. Write a program to reverse the second half region of a DNA sequence. "ATGATAGATAGATGATATCGATAGTA".
